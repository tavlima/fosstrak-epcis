** CaptureClient

  A concrete instance of a binding implemented as a HTTP post request. The format of the request is:

+-------------------------------+

event = [EventInXml]*

** CaptureClientGui

  User interface to create a single instance of an event which is transferred to the server via a client relationship with the CaptureClient. It will display the server response in a separate window.

** CaptureEvent

  Mapping of a real world event to a java class.
  It represents one of the following events depending on the value of the attributes:
  
    * ObjectEvent
    
    * AggregationEvent
    
    * QuantityEvent
    
    * TransactionEvent
  
  The parameters as a whole describe the change of the physical state that the products were transferred to with this event.
